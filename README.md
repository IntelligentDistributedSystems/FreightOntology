### Description
The proposed logistics ontology consists of 3 parts. We preferred  to  present  them  separately,  for  a  better  analysis  of the  problem  domain. The four proposed ontologies are: Transport Request Ontology, Transport Resource Ontology and Freight Ontology. Transport Request Ontology describes the elements of a transport request, Transport Resource Ontology describes transport resource capabilities, Freight Ontology describes the freight that must be transported.
