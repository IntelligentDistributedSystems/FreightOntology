{"name":"Freight Transport Ontology","tagline":"Freight Transport Ontology","body":"We  provide  an  ontology  for  the development  of  a  freight  transportation  broker, with the aim of connecting cargo owners with the freight transportation providers through appropriate contracts. \r\n\r\n### Repository Contents\r\n- Ontology version 1 \r\n- Ontology version 2\r\n- Comparison between Ontology-v1 and Ontology-v2\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThe proposed logistics ontology consists of 3 parts. We preferred  to  present  them  separately,  for  a  better  analysis  of the  problem  domain. The four proposed ontologies are: Transport Request Ontology, Transport Resource Ontology and Freight Ontology. Transport Request Ontology describes the elements of a transport request, Transport Resource Ontology describes transport resource capabilities, Freight Ontology describes the freight that must be transported.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nLucian Luncean, Romanian-German University of Sibiu, Romania\r\nBecheru Alexandru, University of Craiova, Romania\r\nCostin Badica, University of Craiova, Romania\r\nFor more info about the authors please do visit the [Intelligent Distributed Systems Research Group](http://ids.software.ucv.ro/) web-site.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nFor support regarding Github problems please do contact @becheru\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
